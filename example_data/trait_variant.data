#First column indicates record type: = Trait, > SNP, >> Variant at SNP
#=	Trait Name	Trait Description	Predictability	Handler (Loads Data and Renders Template)
#>	SNP RS
#>>	Genotype	Short Description (Shown on Trait List)	Long Description (Shown in SNP Box)
#
# * Trait Predictability is scored from 0 (Worst) to 3 (Best)
# * Entering '-' for a trait's Handler will cause the default handler to be used
# * Trait Handler names must not include the .pl extension
# * Note that an RS ID can appear underneath many traits
# * All SNP RS IDs and Variant Genotypes must be defined in the SNP Data file
# * Descriptions for Variants are to be given in the context of the current trait
# * Any record that does not begin with =, >, or >> will be ignored
